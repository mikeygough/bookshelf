## Getting Started (Mikey's)

### The Gist:

Bookshelf is exactly as it sounds; a virtual bookshelf!

Data is loaded from book-data.json and rendered to the user as a grid of books. Users can then click on a book to be taken to its details page via React Router Dom. The details page includes additional information about a book such as if has been read, its rating, comments and quotes. Bookshelf uses colors from Tailwind & animations from Framer Motion.

Bookshelf is mobile-friendly and actively deployed at https://mikeygough.github.io/bookshelf/
