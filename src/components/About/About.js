      <p>
        Reading is nice. Sometimes I read in the morning. Sometimes I
        read after lunch. I always read before bed. As Horace Mann
        wrote,{' '}
        <q>A house without books is like a room without windows.</q>{' '}
        Here you'll find a display of the books I've recently finished
        along with some information about them, my star-review and
        selected quotes.
